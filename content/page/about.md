# About this blog
This is the showcase for the Tailwind Nuxt Starter Blog.

In addition to being just a demo, I intend to include instructions on how to setup this project for your personal blog 
and customize some of the features.

# About the project
When I started this project, my main goal is to find a platform that can keep the content separated from the technology as complete as possible.  This came from the past painful experience with early blogging sites such as blogger.com.  Later moved to Wordpress which makes it possible to migrate from one hosting company to another, but the content is still locked in Wordpress format. In searching for a better alternative, I decide I want to keep all my content in Markdown format so that it will not be out dated along with the platform.  Markdown is open, portable, parsable and is widely adopted and supported.  I use it daily for my work, so it comes as a natural choice.  

Fortunately, there are many great solutions out there so it is not difficult to find one as my start point.  I am not in the business of making another blog platform, this project is mainly for my personal blog.  As a developer, we all have the curiosity on how things work, the opinions on how things should work and the ability to make change as necessary.  As I have had some experiences with NuxtJs in recent years, it feels like I want to use it for my blogging project too.  I really like the simplicity and elegance of [Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) project. Due to the similarity between Nextjs and Nuxtjs, it is not difficult to port it over, thus I created this project.
